### Issue creation rules

Issues can be created by **any** GitHub user.

Issues are **valid** when are created based on one of the issue templates available.

Invalid issued are **discarded**.


### Kanban functioning rules

After an issue is created, it must be added to one of the Projects' Kanbans to be discussed.

Bug issues go to the **Bugs Kanban**, anything else goes to the **Not-a-bug Kanban**.


Bugs start at the **Triage column**.

They are sorted according to priority based on discussion.

A higher priority means it should be fixed sooner to attend milestones.

When someone chooses to implement it, it is moved to the **In progress** column.

After implemented and tested, it is moved to the **Done** column.


Other issues start at the **Discussion column**.

When it is agreed that an issue should be implemented, it goes to the **To do** column.

When someone chooses to implement it, it is moved to the **In progress** column.

After implemented and tested, it is moved to the **Done** column.


### Discussion rules

The discussion is between the owners.

Currently, owners are:
* @gmramella
* @rodrigo-machado

@gmramella is authorized to move bugs to any priority column before discussion.
