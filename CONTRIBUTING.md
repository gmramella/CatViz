### Issue creation rules

Issues can be created by **any** GitHub user.

Issues are **valid** when are created based on one of the issue templates available.

Invalid issues are **discarded**.

Users with an intolerable amount of invalid issues are **blocked**.

Users who do not follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gmramella/CatViz/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) are **blocked**.


### Tips for inserting images in issues

Sometimes an image can be easily copied to the issue with CTRL+C/CTRL+X followed by CTRL+V, or equivalent.

If that does not work, you can paste the image onto [snag.gy](https://snag.gy) and reference the link the page provides.


### Kanban functioning rules

After an issue is created, it must be added to one of the Projects' Kanbans to be discussed.

Bug issues go to the **Bugs Kanban**, anything else goes to the **Not-a-bug Kanban**.


Bugs start at the **Triage column**.

They are sorted according to priority based on discussion.

A higher priority means it should be fixed sooner to attend milestones.

When someone chooses to implement it, it is moved to the **In progress** column.

After implemented and tested, it is moved to the **Done** column.


Other issues start at the **Discussion column**.

When it is agreed that an issue should be implemented, it goes to the **To do** column.

When someone chooses to implement it, it is moved to the **In progress** column.

After implemented and tested, it is moved to the **Done** column.


### Discussion rules

The discussion is between the maintainers.

The list of maintainers can be found on the Code of Conduct.

@gmramella is authorized to move bugs to any priority column before discussion.
